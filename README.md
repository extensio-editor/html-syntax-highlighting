# HTML syntax highlighting

This library contains a function that will convert a string into HTML with syntax highlighting.
It has support for using tailwind or just standard CSS.

It is very simple and intuitive to use. Simply said string with code goes in highlighted string as HTML comes out.

## Languages

We aim to be able to support the following languages.
The checked ones are currently implemented, the non-checked ones are yet to be implemented.

- [x] TS / TypeScript & JS / JavaScript
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] C++ & C
- [ ] Rust?

You can also create your own language-specific addon, more details in configuring.

## Configuring

You can very easily configure the syntax highlighting to your own needs/likings.
